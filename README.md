This is a linkedlist project that I started in my second week of my backend coding bootcamp
that focuses on Ruby and Ruby on Rails. I am particularly proud of this project, because I was able to
complete all three required iterations of this project, as well as the extension, and I intentionally
wrote my code using TDD principles.
