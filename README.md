This is a Linked List project that I started in my second week of my backend coding bootcamp
that focuses on Ruby and Ruby on Rails. I am particularly proud of this project, because I was able to
complete all three required iterations of this project, as well as the extension, while intentionally
focusing on writing code using TDD principles.

The details of this project can be found [here](https://backend.turing.edu/module1/projects/beat_box/index)
